// Problem Statement#
// You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets, and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.

// You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:

// Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
// You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

// Example 1:

// Input: Fruit=["A", "B", "C", "A", "C"]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: We can put 2 "C" in one basket and one "A" in the other from the subarray ["C", "A", "C"]
// Example 2:

// Input: Fruit=["A", "B", "C", "B", "B", "C"]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: We can put 3 "B" in one basket and two "C" in the other basket.
// This can be done if we start with the second letter: ["B", "C", "B", "B", "C"]
